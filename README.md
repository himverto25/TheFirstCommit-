Project Name: Temperature Unit Converter
Programming Language Used: JAVA
Frameworks: Spring and AWT
IDE: Apache Netbeans
Description:
This project is a temperture unit converter created using JAVA and had been provided with a GUI using Spring and AWT frameworks provided by JAVA. It includes a 'Temperature' class which is basically a dummy class which is left unused and has been created by default by Apache Netbeans as a result of creation of the projecthaving the same name.
It has a 'Interface' JFrame that consists of all the GUI-based elements such as the ComboBox, TextField, TextArea, JPanel, JButtons etc. The GUI was created using Drag and Drop using the functionality provided by Apache Netbeans and then later on the  code was modified and a soulful functionality has been infused onto the sample code generated by the IDE.
Experience:
It is indeed an exciting experience of a novice developer like me to make my first commit on GITHUB and infact making this very small project is an initiation of something big to come and it also allowed me to learn a lot of things.
